## Write a C Program to Implement Various Control Flow Statements

### Aim
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of if-else, switch-case, and loop control flow to solve a real-world problem.

### Example Problem
**Problem Statement:** Write a program that takes user input to select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and applies the operation to two input numbers using if-else, switch-case, and loop control flows.

#### Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Declare variables for two numbers and the user's choice.
3. Use a menu-driven approach with a loop to display options for arithmetic operations.
4. Take user input for the choice and validate it.
5. Based on the choice, use if-else or switch-case to perform the selected arithmetic operation.
6. Print the result and ask if the user wants to perform another calculation.
7. End the program when the user chooses to exit.

#### Flowchart
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Declare variables for numbers and choice];
    B --> C[Repeat until user chooses to exit];
    C --> D[Display menu: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exit];
    D --> E[Input choice from user];
    E --> F{Is choice valid?};
    F -- No --> G[Print 'Invalid choice' and repeat];
    F -- Yes --> H{Is choice Exit?};
    H -- Yes --> I[End];
    H -- No --> J[Input numbers];
    J --> K[Perform arithmetic operation based on choice];
    K --> L[Print result];
    L --> C;
```
- **Details:** This flowchart represents the program flow where the user is repeatedly asked to select an arithmetic operation until they choose to exit.

#### Hint Code Snippet
- Use a loop to display the menu.
- Take the user's choice and apply an if-else or switch-case to perform the corresponding operation.
  ```c
  int choice, a, b;
  do {
      printf("\nMenu:\n1. Addition\n2. Subtraction\n3. Multiplication\n4. Division\n5. Exit\nEnter your choice: ");
      scanf("%d", &choice);
      if (choice >= 1 && choice <= 4) {
          printf("Enter two numbers: ");
          scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
      }
      switch (choice) {
          case 1: printf("Result: %d\n", a + b); break;
          case 2: printf("Result: %d\n", a - b); break;
          case 3: printf("Result: %d\n", a * b); break;
          case 4: if (b != 0) printf("Result: %d\n", a / b); else printf("Division by zero error\n"); break;
          case 5: printf("Exiting...\n"); break;
          default: printf("Invalid choice. Try again.\n");
      }
  } while (choice != 5);
  ```
- **Hint:** Validate the user's input to handle invalid choices effectively.

#### Suggested Programs
1. Write a program to calculate the power of a number using a loop and if-else control flow.
2. Write a menu-driven program to take a point (x, y) as input from the user and print if it lies on X-axis, Y-axis or origin.
3. Write a menu-driven program to take the lengths of the sides of a triangle as input from the user and print the type of the triangle.
