### Aim

To understand and implement the use of pointers in C programming.

### Example Problems

#### Example 1: Pointer Arithmetic

**Problem Statement:** Write a program to demonstrate pointer arithmetic by iterating through a character array and printing its elements using pointer notation.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Start the program.
2.  Declare a character array and initialize it with some values.
3.  Declare a pointer variable and point it to the base address of the array.
4.  Use a loop to traverse the array using the pointer.
5.  Print each element of the array by dereferencing the pointer.
6.  End the program.

**Flowchart:**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Declare character array and pointer];
    B --> C[Initialize pointer to array base];
    C --> D[Loop through array using pointer];
    D --> E[Print element using pointer dereferencing];
    E --> F[End];

```

#### Example 2: Call by Reference

**Problem Statement:** Write a program to demonstrate the concept of call by reference by passing a variable's address to a function and modifying its value.

**Algorithm:**

1.  Start the program.
2.  Declare an integer variable and initialize it with a value.
3.  Define a function that accepts a pointer to an integer as a parameter.
4.  Inside the function, modify the value of the variable using dereferencing.
5.  Call the function by passing the address of the variable.
6.  Print the modified value of the variable.
7.  End the program.

**Flowchart:**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Declare variable and initialize];
    B --> C[Define function with pointer parameter];
    C --> D[Call function with variable address];
    D --> E[Modify variable value using dereferencing];
    E --> F[Return to main function];
    F --> G[Print modified value];
    G --> H[End];

```
