# Demonstrating the Use of Arrays in C

## Objective: Write C Programs to Demonstrate the Use of Arrays

### Aim

To understand and implement various operations on arrays in C, including initialization, accessing elements, and performing computations.

### Example Problem 1: Finding the Largest Element in an Array

**Problem Statement:** Write a program to input an array of integers and find the largest element.

#### Algorithm

1.  Start the program.
    
2.  Declare an array and variables for size and largest element.
    
3.  Input the size of the array.
    
4.  Input elements into the array.
    
5.  Initialize the largest element as the first element.
    
6.  Traverse the array to compare and find the largest element.
    
7.  Print the largest element.
    
8.  End the program.
    

-   The comparison checks each element of the array against the current largest value.
    

### Example Problem 2: Summing Elements of an Array

**Problem Statement:** Write a program to input an array and calculate the sum of all elements.

#### Algorithm

1.  Start the program.
    
2.  Declare an array and variables for size and sum.
    
3.  Input the size of the array.
    
4.  Input elements into the array.
    
5.  Initialize sum to 0.
    
6.  Traverse the array and add each element to the sum.
    
7.  Print the total sum.
    
8.  End the program.
    

### Suggested Programs
        
1.  **Reverse an Array:**
    
    -   **Conceptual Hint:** Swap the first element with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.
        
3.  **Count Occurrences of a Specific Element in an Array:**
    
    -   **Conceptual Hint:** Traverse the array and increment a counter whenever the element matches the specified value.
        
4.  **Merge Two Arrays:**
    
    -   **Conceptual Hint:** Combine two arrays into a third array by appending elements.
        
5.  **Find the Second Largest Element in an Array:**
    
    -   **Conceptual Hint:** Use two variables to track the largest and second-largest elements during traversal.
